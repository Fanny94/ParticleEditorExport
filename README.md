# ParticleEditorExport
This is a poarticle editor I created for a game me and other students made as a big game project.

To run the particle editor, build the Erebus.sin project in visual studio.

This is a basic Particle editor. It supoorts loading a texture file and makes particles out of the texture. 
You can adjust size, speed, lifetime, direction, gravity etc. The particle textures we used can be found in ..\Erebus\Textures folder in the repo.
